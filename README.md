## Description

These are my dotfiles from the zsh. Use ist to customice the appearence and the behavior of your shell.

For Running the zsh with the whole functionallity you need the following applications:

- https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-history-substring-search
- pkgfile (Arch Linux)

There are some alieses, which are specific to my system. You can use them as a exayple for your own specific aliases.

The substring-search is set by default on press up and down key. If nothing is typed in the shell, up and down walk normaly through the history. It is tested und Arch Linux.
